Currently a computer science student at The University of Manchester.

## Experience

I've mainly worked on developing full-stack web applications at [Gustav Adolf Grammar School](http://gag.ee),
[Teleport, Inc](https://teleport.org), [Testlio, Inc](https://testlio.com), and [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com). In 2016 I also co-founded [Cody](https://cody.ee).

## Volunteering

I have been really committed to do volunteering while in Manchester. Over the years I have made sure [HackSoc Manchester](http://hacksoc.com) has some great events in the calendar and helped out with everything at the [Baltic Society](http://balticsociety.uk). I was also the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](http://www.se.manchester.ac.uk/) Undergraduate Officer at the
[University of Manchester Students' Union](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com) where I represented the undergraduates of the nine schools within the largest faculty in the university. I've also sat on the [Education Committee](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/top-navigation/student-voice/senate/senate-committees/education-committee) in the [Students' Union's Senate](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/senate) - the policy-making body of the largest Students' Union in the UK. As a faculty UG representative I've also sat on the [Teaching and Learning Leadership Team](http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/fse/academic-services/teaching-and-learning/committees-and-working-groups/teaching-and-learning-leadership/) of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Currently I'm on the [Staff Student Committee](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/sscc/) and the School Board as a Student Rep at the School of Computer Science.
