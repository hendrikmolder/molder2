I've been learning the piano under the instruction of my piano teacher from the Kapp (known Estonian composer) family since I was little. This passion of music grew into interest in the organs when my high school - Gustav Adolf Grammar School (GAG) - was donated two organs in 2015.

At GAG, a signature piece (inspired by Handel's Music for The Royal Fireworks) was developed for the School by an Estonian organist Toomas Trass. It quickly became a tradition to start every formal celebration, event, welcoming of domestic and foreign delegations with the signature piece played on the organ. As music teachers found the fully mechanical 100-year-old organ hard (and one really has to apply some force sometimes) to learn and play, I enjoyed playing for presidents, heads of governments, ministers and secretaries, as well as teachers and students from abroad over the three years I spent at GAG. One could say I became the School Organist. Since then I've performed at organ festivals, and sometimes in music shows in Estonian Television and Classical Radio. More recently I've been playing in Whitworth Hall at The University of Manchester.
