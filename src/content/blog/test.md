_This post is being updated._

I visited various tracks and listened to a lot of different talks — it’s difficult to put them all together into one post; I picked a couple of enlightening topics and will try to give a quick high-level overview with links to more resources here.

Refresh has a very clear focus on the product, design, and front-end to inspire people to build great experiences on the web. There are always a lot of product engineers, developers, designers, and other professionals sharing their experiences from companies like Google, Microsoft, TransferWise, Intercom, Booking.com, Taxify and others. Here’s a quick throwback to the conference.

# Common ways we break website accessibility

[Laura Carvajal](https://twitter.com/lc512k) from The Financial Times showed videos of website accessibility audits (link to her talk at the end of this section), where users with disabilities tried to use some websites. There are some very elementary concepts that make a huge difference for some users in terms of accessibility.

## Tab order and focus outline

Some users cannot — for various reasons — use mouse for navigating on websites. As an alternative, they usually tab through the site. When an element is selected (it is in focus), it should be reflected by the **focus outline** (by default #5b9dd9; should be a colour that has a great contrast with the site’s colour palette). However, often we decide to override this browser default behaviour by setting the focus outline to `0px` — this is how we break the web for a large number of users. Instead, if the default light blue colour looks weird on our website, we should pick a better colour — that would also _improve_ accessibility.

**Tab order** (the order in which the user can tab through the site) is usually generated by the browser — it might happen that some elements are left out of the tab order. That’s usually the case when we use some elements not in the way they were designed to be used. For example, we might want to make a `span` clickable — but elements such as `span` and `p` are not interactive by default and therefore omitted from tab order. We can make sure the element is added to tab order by the browser by adding `taborder="0"` to it (see example below). This tells the browser to add the element to the tab order based on its location on the website

```
// Default focus outline behaviour in Google Chrome
a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #ace
}
// tabIndex attribute example.
<span onClick="boo()" tabindex="0">Course information</span>
```

## Use of headings

As Laura elaborated in her talk, we might sometimes just use headings in ways we shouldn’t as a convenient alternative of having to write CSS. However, for people using screen readers to navigate through the website, it is important that the way headings are organised makes sense. If your page has multiple `h1` headings, it might confuse some screen readers; same goes if your page has, let’s say, many lower-level `h3` headings without any `h1` and `h2` headings.

So, as most screen readers organise the website based on the hierarchy of the headings, make sure you use them as you should.

# Serverless and SPAs

Having worked with **SPA**s (single page application) recently, I was curious what [Asim Hussain](https://twitter.com/jawache?lang=en) from Microsoft had to say on this topic. SPAs have become quite popular in recent years as they are easier to develop, maintain, and are (should be) more mobile friendly (fewer requests and full page reloads — should consume less data). The main difference between a SPA and a regular website is that in SPAs we don’t do full page reloads every time an action has happened (such as navigating to a new page). Instead, only data is queried (if needed) and the rest is rendered dynamically by JavaScript. When you first access a SPA, only one page `index.html` is loaded (that’s where the name comes from) and after that JavaScript “takes over”.

## What’s Serverless and how did we get to it?

Asim put it quite nicely in his talk: we started with on-premise infrastructure where the customer was responsible for everything, including the hardware components of your server. Then, the industry came up with IaaS (infrastructure as a service) — now, when something happened with the hardware it was not the customer’s responsibility anymore. PaaS (platform as a service) created even more abstraction (customer responsible for the framework) and so did FaaS (functions as a service).

> Hey, how many servers do we need for the next 6 months?

In the past this was a valid question (and probably at some places it still is…) — we had to estimate the load on our servers and make sure we have enough so our website performs well. Having too many would mean paying for resources we never use and having too little means our website could perform poorly.

**Serverless** means you don’t have to care about servers anymore and you only pay for actual (not predicted) use of the resources — that is achieved with auto-scaling. So essentially we can just build and deploy our websites without ever having to worry about the servers — all that is done for us automatically. More or fewer resources are allocated to our website as needed.

**FaaS** is a relatively new concept and enables us to have functions in the cloud that we can execute without having to build and maintain a complex infrastructure. You also only pay for the time your function takes to run.

However, Serverless isn’t just FaaS; here’s a good article that explains Serverless and FaaS in more detail.
