**Bio.** Hi! I'm [Hendrik](https://linkedin.com/in/hendrikmolder), a Software Engineer from
[Tallinn, Estonia](https://teleport.org/cities/tallinn/). Currently, I reside in
[Manchester, United Kingdom](https://teleport.org/cities/manchester/), where I study Computer Science
at [The University of Manchester](http://manchester.ac.uk).

**Experience.** In terms of programming languages, I have experience with C, Java, SQL,
JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, MatLAB. However, recently I have done my projects with various
JavaScript frameworks (i.e. React.js), Java, and C. I have been a part of the following
amazing organisations and companies: [Gustav Adolf Grammar School](http://gag.ee),
[Teleport, Inc](https://teleport.org), and [Testlio, Inc](https://testlio.com). In 2016 I also
co-founded [Cody](https://cody.ee).

**Volunteering.** Currently, I volunteer in three areas: organising events, managing a society, and
representing students. I make sure [HackSoc Manchester](http://hacksoc.com) has some great events to offer
and help out with everything at the [Baltic Society](http://balticsociety.uk). I'm also the
[Faculty of Science and Engineering](http://www.se.manchester.ac.uk/) Undergraduate Officer at the
[University of Manchester Students' Union](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com) where I represent the UG
students of the nine schools within the largest faculty in the university. I also sit on the [Education Committee](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/top-navigation/student-voice/senate/senate-committees/education-committee) in the [Students' Union's
Senate](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/senate) - the policymaking body of the largest Students' Union
in the UK. As a faculty UG representative I also sit on the [Teaching and Learning Leadership Team](http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/fse/academic-services/teaching-and-learning/committees-and-working-groups/teaching-and-learning-leadership/) of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. I'm also part of the [Staff Student Committee](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/sscc/) and the School Board as a Student Rep at the School of Computer Science.
