When I was a kid, I had the pleasure of learning the piano under the instruction from my teacher from the Kapp family. This passion of music grew into interest in organs once my school - Gustav Adolf Grammar School (GAG) - was donated two organs.

Curious as I am, I could not resist trying out the organs - and after that things moved quite fast. Soon a _signature_ was developed for the School and for the time I was at GAG probably every formal celebration, event, welcoming of domestic and foreign delegations started with the signature played on the organ. I'm pretty sure I played at least couple times a week. As music teachers found the 100-years-old organ hard to learn and play, I enjoyed playing for presidents, heads of governments, ministers and secretaries, as well as teachers and students from abroad.

I've performed at organ festivals, and sometimes in music shows in Estonian television and Classical Radio.
